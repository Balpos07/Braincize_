        <h1>BIOGRAPHY: Dr Calvin Flowers</h1>
        <h3>During the Freshman year of Medical School at the University of Illinois Chicago, I had the opportunity to embark on research not only <br> in Cardiothoracic Surgery on the team preparing for the first Cardiac Transplant at the University of Illinois Chicago Medical <br> Center in 1984 but also Research in MRI Imaging, a recently new imaging modality in 1984 under the Chief of Radiology and MRI <br> Chief Dr. Mahmood Mafee now at the University of California San Diego. <br> My research in MRI was simply to utilize MRI Imaging to evaluate the also recent major Public Health problem patients with HIV/AIDS mainly from the <br> West Side VA Hospital as well as patients from nearby Cook County Hospital (Chicago’s largest public hospital) where the majority of the HIV/AIDS  <br> patients were admitted. My research in using MRI to evaluate AIDS Dementia is a landmark paper that is cited daily throughout the Neurosciences including Neurological,  <br> Psychiatric and Neurosurgical Departments and literature. The Paper recently gained recognition by the American Journal of Neuroradiology for being one  <br> of the most important papers over the past 30 years in MRI imaging of the Infections of the Central Nervous System. I continued MRI Research throughout  <br> the rest of my Medical School Career with Oral presentations and Posters including presentations at the American Society of Head and Neck Radiology  <br> and the American Roentgen Ray Society. After graduating from Medical School at the University of Illinois Chicago, I participated in Internship in Medicine  <br> followed by a Residency in Diagnostic Imaging the largest Public Hospital and Trauma Center in Chicago, Cook County Hospital where I continued studying many cohorts  <br>of HIV/AIDS patients using MRI Imaging resulting in my teaching at the world's largest Radiology Conference, the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). <br> I presented many Scientific Posters on MR Imaging Teaching Radiologists Worldwide including topics in Neuroradiological , Musculoskeletal and Body imaging with MRI. I have given many lectures throughout my career including the famous Noon Conference at the University of Chicago, the MRI Evening Seminars and Lectures <br> at the University of Illinois as well as The Noon Neuroradiological Lectures at Rush Medical Center on every aspects of MRI Imaging. Following Residency in <br> Diagnostic Radiology , I did a Neuroradiology Fellowship for 2 years in Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology , at Rush Presbyterian  <br>Medical Center in Chicago where I continued my Research utilizing MRI Imaging and presented Abstracts and Scientific Posters at the American Society of Neuroradiology as well as the  <br> world’s largest medical Conference namely The Radiological Society of North America. Following the Neuroradiology Fellowship at Rush Medical  <br>Center, under the directorship of Neuroradiology Pioneer Dr. Michael Huckman, I returned to academic medicine from the Private sector to which I was personally asked  <br> by the former Chief of Radiology at the University of Illinois Chicago ,world renowned Head and Neck Specialist Dr Mahmood Mafee to come back and help  <br> with establishing and managing the newly bought MRI Unit at the Veterans Hospital in Chicago.  The development and growth of MRI Imaging at the Veteran’s Hospital over  <br> the past 20 years has been solely due to my hard work and dedication to Image our Veteran patients with Routine and Advanced Imaging protocols and  <br> even providing imaging techniques not performed at our collegial VA Medical Centers in the VISN but on a level compared to our University Affiliates. <br> I was involved with early MRI Liver Imaging with Ferridex and Eovist Contrast material and I was on the 1st Committee along with Representatives from selected Universities throughout the  <br> USA who met for the 1st MRI Abdominal and Liver Imaging Protocol Meeting here in Chicago in 1997 where the MRI templates and protocols for Liver neoplasms utilized  <br> today were developed.  <br> I pioneered early Cardiac MR Imaging at the Veteran’s Hospital Department of Radiology using a 1.0-Tesla MRI Unit to evaluate Cardiac Morphology and anatomical diseases  <br>as well as Congenital Cardiac Diseases manifested in our Veterans. My personal experiences in CT as well as MRI imaging have had a public association by me  <br>being chosen by previous Department Chiefs to be listed as an MRI Imaging VA Expert Witness for several major Medical Litigation cases <br> around the country. <br> This also parallel my role as Special Medical Expert Witness in the public and private arena.  <br>

I have recently retired from my contribution to servicing the veterans and public medicine and public health but I am still currently on staff in Academic <br> Medicine at Rush Medical Center , Chicago as Assistant Professor on Teaching Assignment for the Department of Radiology including  <br>Residents and Fellows as well as Clinicians throughout the Medical Center.  <br>

I am finishing an article on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury(mTBI) which will show the utility of Routine MRI Imaging as a Biomarker for mTBI/Concussion in <br> Military service members returning home from Middle East conflicts as well as Sport Athletes suffering Concussive and Subconcussive injuries. I was recently asked to submit an Abstract to the <br> National Football League (NFL) for an NFL Grant for ideas to diagnose Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). <br> 

In 1993 I was an investor and Imaging Specialist for a Company VOXEL in which I was a team member who helped to develop the utility of 3D-MRI Holographic  <br>techniques as an aid for Physicians to visualize 3D Holographic MR Images prior to procedures including Neurosurgical and Abdominal Procedures prior to surgical procedures.  <br>


I am a married father of three children with my eldest in the API Development Teaching Arena, my middle child in Media and Communications and  <br> my youngest still in College in Business and Cyber Security. I am an avid music fan and the President of a record label in the genre of Reggae  <br> music inspired by Bob Marley as a youth growing up in Belize City as well due to my caribbean cultural and history. I love soccer  <br>and basketball and will attend the games sporadically.
